## Introduction

I came into this project intent on focusing on the "medical-tangent" space with a specific interest in brain imaging, and wound up studying/utilizing fMRI data. My naivety with fMRI sure got the best of me here, as boy was the data a pain in the ass to wrap my head around, yet I had an absolute blast doing so.

As a means of establishing a theoretical baseline regarding fMRI and neuroimaging, I interviewed Talha Rafique, a researcher at USC Institute for Technology and Medical Systems's Khan Lab. While doing so, we reached the conclusion that attepting to extract the different stages of learning from fMRI data is less than ideal, due to the somewhat ambigious nature of fMRI. At the risk of signficant oversimplification, fMRI captures where the oxygenated blood is flowing in your brain (through detecting iron concentration with big magnets). While doing so may tell us what regions of the brain are currently "active", results from fMRI may be slightly misleading, as there is oxygenated blood everywhere in your brain, and its concentration dosent vary vastly enough to truly distill down what region of the brain is truly most "active".

Talha suggested that I povit to EEG data, as doing so would allow for much higher confidence in brain region activation during a task (such as learning/recall).
