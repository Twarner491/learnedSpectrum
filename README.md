## Introduction

I came into this project intent on focusing on the "medical-tangent" space with a specific interest in brain imaging, and wound up studying/utilizing fMRI data. My naivety with fMRI sure got the best of me here, as boy was the data a pain in the ass to wrap my head around, yet I had an absolute blast doing so.

As a means of establishing a theoretical baseline regarding fMRI and neuroimaging, I interviewed Talha Rafique, a researcher at USC Institute for Technology and Medical Systems's Khan Lab.
